### **Women in Mathematics**
Whether in secondary school, college, university or professional life, being a woman or a member of a gender minority and wanting to pursue mathematics can sometimes lead to unwelcome comments, bad jokes and sexist behaviour. For this reason, I joined the <a href="https://femmes-et-maths.fr" target="_blank">Women in Maths</a> association to promote gender equality in mathematics, encourage women's participation in STEM fields, and create a supportive community for female mathematicians. Recent scientific research on the gender gap can be found <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-09126-4" target="_blank">here</a>.

### **French Biostatistics Days 2024**
I co-organised with <a href="https://helios2.mi.parisdescartes.fr/~vperduca/" target="_blank">Vittorio Perduca</a> and <a href="https://perso.math.univ-toulouse.fr/psaintpi/" target="_blank">Philippe Saint-Pierre</a> the French Biostatistics Days 2024, hosted at PariSanté Campus. 
These days bring together the biostatistics community, from academic researchers to industry experts, jointly organized by <a href="https://math-bio-sante.math.cnrs.fr/index.html" target="_blank">CNRS (via the Statistiques et Santé network of "Math Bio Santé")</a>, the <a href="https://sfb.pages.math.cnrs.fr/asso/" target="_blank">French Society of Biometry</a> and the group of <a href="https://www.sfds.asso.fr/fr/biopharmacie_et_sante/457-groupe_biopharmacie_et_sante/" target="_blank">SFdS Biopharmacie et Santé</a>.

### **HeKA Junior Seminar**
I took over from <a href="https://www.linusbleistein.com/" target="_blank">Linus Bleistein</a> as the organizer of the monthly junior seminar at <a href="https://parisantecampus.fr" target="_blank">PariSanté Campus</a>. This seminar brings together young researchers from all labs, fostering collaboration and discussions on topics at the crossroads of statistics/ML and healthcare.
